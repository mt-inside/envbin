		// TODO: Would be nice to mark plugins as timed-out. Atm they do it (if they notice), but a) they have to notice and b) the channel will be closed at that point. When plugins are registered, that should be with the prefix - we record that so we can write TimedOut entires on their behalf. Also means they don't have to use their full prefix everywhere (pass them a PrefixChan()?). Yes several write to several parts of the tree; they should register multiple times for each prefix they "own" (one compilation unit per /source/, but not per tree prefix). Enforce that they don't clash - nothing should add a value or child as a sibling of a _value_ (or a value as a sibling of a child?)
