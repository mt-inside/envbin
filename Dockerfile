# Because we're building *in* a container for a container, there's no cross-OS-compilation; no need to specify GOOS
# Also because we take ARG ARCH and use buildx (invokes qemu), we always use the native compiler for any platform; never any need to specify GOARCH
# TODO: understand this better, then consider -tags netgo,osusergo etc to use go bits instead of c bits (which we statically link in here)
